Once upon a time, there was a rabbit.

This rabbit was different. He had a dream to be something special. He was different than everyone else in his village.

All of the others were okay with living an ordinary provincial rabbit life. Tending the carrot stand, raising a family, and retiring.

But this rabbit was not.

He wanted to live a different life. One were what he did became an expression of who he was.

So he left his rabbit home, in search of freedom in the big city. To this little rabbit, freedom meant self-expression and excitement, which had been so missing from his life at home. He always felt “odd” or “different,” but knew he was destined for greatness.

However, once the rabbit made it to the city, he no longer felt odd or different. In fact, the rabbit felt lost, alone, and similar.

He had dreamed his entire life about the day when he would finally break free from the chains of his childhood and burst into a new life. But now that he had accomplished it, he knew not what to do next.
